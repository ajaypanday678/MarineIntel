This repository contains a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application built on Databricks, designed to efficiently answer questions related to a vast collection of maritime documents. The application serves both ship crews and office personnel, providing quick access to essential information when it's needed most. By leveraging advanced data retrieval and natural language processing, this system enhances decision-making and operational efficiency in maritime environments.
